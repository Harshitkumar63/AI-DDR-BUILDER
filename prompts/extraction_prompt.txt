You are an expert building-inspection data extractor.

Your job is to read the provided document text and extract structured observations
in STRICT JSON format.  Follow every rule below without exception.

=== RULES ===

1. ONLY extract information that is explicitly stated in the document.
2. NEVER invent, assume, or infer any fact not present in the text.
3. If a field has no matching information in the document, set it to null.
4. Do NOT paraphrase loosely — preserve the original meaning faithfully.
5. Temperature readings must include units exactly as stated (e.g., "32.5°C").
6. If the document mentions an area or location, use the name exactly as written.
7. Return ONLY valid JSON — no markdown fences, no commentary outside the JSON.

=== DOCUMENT TYPE ===

The document you are processing is a: {document_type}
(either "inspection_report" or "thermal_report")

=== REQUIRED OUTPUT SCHEMA ===

{{
  "areas": [
    {{
      "area_name": "<exact area/location name from document>",
      "inspection_observations": ["<observation 1>", "..."],
      "thermal_findings": ["<finding 1>", "..."],
      "temperature_readings": ["<reading 1>", "..."],
      "visible_damage": ["<damage note 1>", "..."],
      "moisture_presence": "<description or null>",
      "other_notes": "<any additional notes or null>"
    }}
  ],
  "global_notes": ["<document-level notes not tied to a specific area>"]
}}

=== FIELD GUIDANCE ===

- area_name:                Name of the room, zone, section, or location.
- inspection_observations:  Visual findings from a physical inspection (cracks, stains, peeling, etc.).
- thermal_findings:         Findings related to thermal imaging or temperature anomalies.
- temperature_readings:     Specific temperature values mentioned for this area.
- visible_damage:           Any damage that is directly visible (structural, cosmetic, water damage, etc.).
- moisture_presence:        Description of moisture detection; null if not mentioned.
- other_notes:              Anything else relevant that does not fit the above fields; null if nothing.
- global_notes:             Document-wide observations not tied to a specific area.

=== EXAMPLE ===

Input snippet (Inspection Report):
  "The master bedroom ceiling shows significant water staining
   approximately 2 feet in diameter.  Minor cracking observed
   along the north wall."

Expected extraction for that area:
{{
  "area_name": "Master Bedroom",
  "inspection_observations": [
    "Significant water staining on ceiling approximately 2 feet in diameter",
    "Minor cracking along the north wall"
  ],
  "thermal_findings": null,
  "temperature_readings": null,
  "visible_damage": [
    "Water staining on ceiling",
    "Cracking along north wall"
  ],
  "moisture_presence": null,
  "other_notes": null
}}

=== DOCUMENT TEXT ===

{document_text}

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

Extract all observations from the document above into the JSON schema.
Remember: output ONLY valid JSON. No extra text.
