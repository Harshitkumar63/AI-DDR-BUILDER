    PROPERTY INSPECTION REPORT
========================================
Date of Inspection: January 15, 2025
Inspector: James Mitchell, Licensed Building Inspector (#BLD-2847)
Property Address: 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield, IL 62704
Property Type: Single-family residential, 2-story
Year Built: 1987

----------------------------------------
SECTION 1: MASTER BEDROOM (2nd Floor)
----------------------------------------
The master bedroom ceiling shows significant water staining approximately
2 feet in diameter near the northwest corner. The staining has visible
yellowing consistent with prolonged moisture exposure. Minor cracking was
observed along the north wall, running approximately 3 feet horizontally.

The carpet near the north wall feels damp to touch. Paint is peeling along
the ceiling edge where the staining is most concentrated.

No visible mold growth observed at the time of inspection, although the
discoloration pattern warrants further investigation.

----------------------------------------
SECTION 2: KITCHEN (1st Floor)
----------------------------------------
The kitchen area shows no significant structural concerns. Minor grout
deterioration was noted in the tile backsplash behind the sink, with
approximately 4 inches of grout missing.

A small hairline crack was observed in the ceiling drywall near the light
fixture. This appears to be cosmetic and not structural.

No moisture or water damage was detected in the kitchen area.

----------------------------------------
SECTION 3: BATHROOM (2nd Floor)
----------------------------------------
The bathroom adjacent to the master bedroom shows signs of moisture damage.
Caulking around the bathtub has deteriorated significantly — approximately
60% of the caulk seal is compromised.

The subfloor near the toilet base feels soft and slightly spongy when
pressure is applied, indicating possible water damage underneath.

Tile grout along the shower wall is cracked and missing in several
locations. Evidence of prior repair attempts visible.

Exhaust fan appears non-functional at the time of inspection.

----------------------------------------
SECTION 4: ATTIC SPACE
----------------------------------------
The attic insulation appears to be fiberglass batt, approximately R-19
value. Insulation coverage is uneven — several areas near the eaves show
gaps of 6-12 inches.

No active roof leaks observed at the time of inspection. However,
staining on the underside of the roof sheathing near the northwest
corner suggests prior water intrusion.

Attic ventilation appears adequate with soffit and ridge vents present.

----------------------------------------
SECTION 5: EXTERIOR - NORTH WALL
----------------------------------------
The exterior north wall shows weathering on the wood siding. Paint is
chipping and peeling in multiple areas, particularly around window frames.

The flashing around the second-floor window appears improperly sealed.
Visible gap of approximately 1/4 inch between the flashing and the siding.

Gutter along the north side is sagging approximately 2 inches in the
center span, which may be causing improper drainage.

----------------------------------------
GENERAL NOTES
----------------------------------------
1. The property is in generally fair condition for its age (38 years).
2. The primary area of concern is moisture intrusion in the northwest
   quadrant of the structure, spanning from the master bedroom ceiling
   through to the attic space.
3. Recommend immediate further investigation by a moisture remediation
   specialist.
4. Electrical and plumbing systems were not evaluated in this inspection.
