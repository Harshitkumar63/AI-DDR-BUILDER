    THERMAL IMAGING REPORT
========================================
Date of Thermal Survey: January 16, 2025
Thermographer: Sarah Chen, Level II Certified Thermographer
Property Address: 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield, IL 62704
Equipment: FLIR T540 Thermal Camera
Ambient Temperature: 28°F (-2.2°C)
Indoor Temperature: 68°F (20°C)

========================================
SECTION 1: MASTER BEDROOM
========================================
Thermal anomaly detected in the northwest corner of the ceiling.
Surface temperature reads 52°F (11.1°C), which is 16°F below the
room average of 68°F. This temperature differential is consistent
with moisture saturation in the ceiling material.

The north wall shows a cold band approximately 4 feet wide running
horizontally at about 8 feet height. Temperature in this band
reads 55°F (12.8°C) compared to the surrounding wall at 65°F (18.3°C).
This pattern suggests inadequate insulation or air infiltration at the
wall-ceiling junction.

Moisture reading via thermal pattern analysis indicates high probability
of active moisture presence in the northwest ceiling area.

========================================
SECTION 2: KITCHEN
========================================
Thermal imaging of the kitchen area shows uniform temperature
distribution across walls and ceiling. No anomalies detected.

Minor thermal bridging observed at the window frame — surface
temperature at frame reads 58°F (14.4°C) versus wall temperature
of 66°F (18.9°C). This is within acceptable range for single-pane
windows.

No moisture signatures detected in the kitchen.

========================================
SECTION 3: 2ND FLOOR BATHROOM
========================================
Significant thermal anomaly detected around the bathtub perimeter.
Floor surface temperature near the tub reads 58°F (14.4°C) versus
the room average of 67°F (19.4°C).

A distinct cold spot was identified at the toilet base — temperature
reads 54°F (12.2°C), suggesting moisture accumulation in the subfloor.

The shower wall shows irregular thermal patterns consistent with
moisture behind the tile surface. Temperature differential of 8°F
measured between dry and affected tile areas.

Active moisture presence confirmed in the bathroom floor and
shower wall areas.

========================================
SECTION 4: ATTIC
========================================
Thermal survey of the attic reveals significant heat loss in
the northwest quadrant. Insulation gaps are clearly visible in
thermal imaging, with surface temperatures varying from 35°F (1.7°C)
in uninsulated areas to 50°F (10°C) in insulated areas.

The roof sheathing in the northwest corner shows a thermal pattern
consistent with prior moisture damage — the affected area measures
approximately 3 feet by 4 feet.

No active moisture detected in the attic at the time of survey.
The staining observed appears to be from a historical event that
has since dried.

========================================
SECTION 5: NORTH EXTERIOR WALL
========================================
Exterior thermal scan of the north wall reveals heat loss around
the second-floor window. Temperature differential of 12°F between
the window perimeter and the surrounding wall surface.

The flashing area shows elevated exterior surface temperature of
45°F (7.2°C) compared to surrounding siding at 30°F (-1.1°C),
indicating warm air escaping through the improper seal.

Thermal imaging confirms improper insulation coverage along the
top plate of the north wall, approximately 6 feet in length.

========================================
GENERAL THERMAL NOTES
========================================
1. Overall thermal envelope integrity is FAIR with notable
   deficiencies in the northwest quadrant.
2. The combination of moisture signatures in the master bedroom
   ceiling and bathroom floor, along with heat loss patterns at
   the north wall, suggests a connected moisture/air infiltration
   pathway.
3. The attic insulation deficiencies correlate with the inspection
   report's observation of gaps near the eaves.
4. Recommend: Blower door test to quantify air infiltration and
   targeted moisture testing with pin-type meter.
